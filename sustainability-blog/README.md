# Welcome to the sustainability blog

This app is a blog style for sustainable products. The idea is the registered users to add products and share personal experience.

## Starting the app:

For now the app is running locally using the npm start.

##  Front end

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Back-end 

As backend for now I am using the SoftUni practice server. [SoftUni Practice Server](https://github.com/softuni-practice-server/softuni-practice-server)

*After creating my own back-end i will update the source.

### Home and Products view

Not registered users can access the home, where the last 3 added products are shown, and  products menu, where all products are listed with their details. Also have access to register or log directly in their accounts.


### Adding new products and personal experience 

Only registered users can create new posts and add, edit or remove their own products. Within this community the registered users can interact via likes/comments with all other posts. 


<!-- ### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it. -->
